# PingBar

A macOS menu bar application for monitoring network connectivity through continuous ping monitoring. PingBar provides at-a-glance visibility into your connection quality with color-coded status indicators and customizable ping targets.

## Features

- **Background Network Monitoring**: Continuously checks multiple ping targets
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Lives in your macOS menu bar for always-visible network status
- **Color-coded Status Indicators**: Visual feedback with different colors based on latency and packet loss thresholds
  - Normal: Ping <80ms, 0% packet loss
  - Yellow: Ping 80-500 ms, 0.1-5% packet loss
  - Orange: Ping 500-1000 ms, 5-25% packet loss
  - Red: Ping > 1000 ms, > 25% packet loss  
- **Customizable Targets**: By default, PingBar checks 2 Google DNS and 2 Cloudflare DNS targets, but you can add or remove addresses as desired
- **Outlier Filtering**: Discards anomalous results for more accurate measurements; you care about your connection quality, not a brief outage of one of the ping targets.

## Usage

1. **Starting**: Launch PingBar and it will appear in your menu bar
2. **Monitoring**: The icon shows current network status with color coding
3. **Pausing**: Use the "Pause" menu item to temporarily stop monitoring
4. **Configuration**: Access "Ping targets" to modify which servers to monitor

### Customizing Targets

1. Click the PingBar icon in your menu bar
2. Select "Ping targets"
3. Enter comma-separated IP addresses in the dialog
4. Click "Save" to apply changes

**Note**: Only IPv4 addresses are currently supported.
