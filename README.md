# <img src="images/PingrThingr.png" width=128/> PingrThingr

A macOS menu bar application for monitoring network connectivity through continuous ping monitoring. PingrThingr provides at-a-glance visibility into your connection quality with color-coded status indicators and customizable ping targets.

## Features

- **Background Network Monitoring**: Continuously checks multiple ping targets
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Lives in your macOS menu bar for always-visible network status
- **Multiple Display Modes**: Choose between different visual representations
  - **Dot Mode**: Simple colored circle indicator (default)

  - **Text Mode**: Detailed latency and packet loss statistics

- **Color-coded Status Indicators**: Visual feedback with different colors based on latency and packet loss thresholds
  - Normal (Uncolored): Ping <80ms, 0% packet loss
  - Yellow: Ping 80-500ms, >0-5% packet loss
  - Orange: Ping 500-1000ms, 5-25% packet loss
  - Red: Ping >1000ms, >25% packet loss  
  - Dotted: No data available

- **Customizable Targets**: By default, PingrThingr checks 2 Google DNS and 2 Cloudflare DNS targets, but you can add or remove addresses as desired

- **Outlier Filtering**: Discards anomalous results for more accurate measurements; you care about your connection quality, not a brief outage of one of the ping targets.

## Usage

### Requirements

- macOS 13 or later
- Python 3.8 or later

### Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `rumps`: For macOS menu bar application framework
- `icmplib`: For network ping functionality
- `pyobjc`: For macOS system integration

### Building the Application
